Components Required:
	ESP32 board (with built-in LED)
	MQ-2 Gas Sensor (4 pins: VCC, GND, AO, DO)
	1 external LED
	Breadboard
	Jumper wires

MQ-2 Gas Sensor:
	VCC (Power pin): Connect the VCC pin of the MQ-2 sensor to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32.
	GND (Ground pin): Connect the GND pin of the MQ-2 sensor to the GND pin on the ESP32.
	AO (Analog Output): Connect the AO pin of the MQ-2 sensor to GPIO 34 (analog input pin) on the ESP32.
	DO (Digital Output): (Optional) If you want to use the digital output feature, you can connect the DO pin to any available GPIO pin. 

External LED:
	Anode (longer leg): Connect the anode of the external LED to GPIO 5 on the ESP32.
	Cathode (shorter leg): Connect the cathode of the external LED to GND on the ESP32.
