Components Required:
	ESP32 board (with built-in LED)
	LDR sensor (3 pins: VCC, GND, and OUT)
	1 external LED
	Breadboard
	Jumper wires

LDR Sensor:
	Connect the VCC pin of the LDR sensor to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32.
	Connect the GND pin of the LDR sensor to the GND pin on the ESP32.
	Connect the OUT pin (analog output) of the LDR sensor to GPIO 34 on the ESP32.

External LED:
	Connect the anode (longer leg) of the external LED to GPIO 23 (LED_PIN2) on the ESP32.
	Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to GND on the ESP32.

Built-in LED (GPIO 2):
	The built-in LED on the ESP32 is already connected to GPIO 2. No additional wiring is needed for this.
