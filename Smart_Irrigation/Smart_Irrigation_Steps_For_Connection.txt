Components Required:
	ESP32
	DHT11 Sensor
	Soil Moisture Sensor

Soil Moisture Sensor to ESP32:
	VCC (Power) pin of the soil moisture sensor to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32.
	GND (Ground) pin of the soil moisture sensor to the GND pin on the ESP32.
	Analog output pin (A0) of the soil moisture sensor to the GPIO34 pin on the ESP32 (this is defined as MOISTURE_PIN in the code).

DHT11 Sensor to ESP32:
	VCC (Power) pin of the DHT11 sensor to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32.
	GND (Ground) pin of the DHT11 sensor to the GND pin on the ESP32.
	Data (Signal) pin of the DHT11 sensor to the GPIO27 pin on the ESP32 (this is defined as DHT_PIN in the code).
